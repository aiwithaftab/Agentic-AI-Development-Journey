# 🚀 Learning Journey: AI & Agentic Workflows

## Current Focus: Introduction to LangChain
I am currently taking a deep dive into building autonomous systems through the **Foundation: Introduction to LangChain - Python** course.

While many interact with AI through simple chat interfaces, I am focusing on the "agentic" side of the spectrum—developing systems that don't just generate text, but proactively take actions to solve complex, multi-step problems.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives
* **LLM Orchestration:** Mastering how to chain prompts, memory, and external tools into a cohesive workflow.
* **Agentic Workflows:** Moving beyond static responses toward autonomous agents that can use tools and make decisions.
* **Python Integration:** Building the robust backends required to power next-generation AI applications.

### 🧠 Why LangChain?
I believe that the ability to build "agents" will define the next decade of software engineering. Despite the fast-moving nature of the field, I am committed to mastering these tools to bridge the gap between AI theory and functional, real-world utility.
