📚 Today's Learning: Structured Prompting with JSON Output

Objective: Learned how to create prompts that instruct an LLM to return responses strictly in a predefined JSON structure.

Key Points:

Use model_dump_json to serialize user input into JSON for prompt injection.

Clearly define the expected JSON structure (example_response_structure) for consistent parsing.

Instruct the model to respond only with valid JSON, avoiding extra text or formatting.

Benefit: Ensures reliable, machine-readable outputs from language models, essential for building agentic workflows and automated pipelines.

Next Step: Explore validation and error handling for model-generated JSON in real applications.
