Key Concepts Learned Today:

Agent Class Design

The Agent class encapsulates the main components of an AI agent:

Goals: What the agent is trying to achieve (goal: List[Goal]).

Language Model Interface: Defines how the agent constructs prompts and generates responses (agent_language: AgentLanguage).

Response Generation: A callable function to produce responses based on prompts (generate_response: Callable).

Actions: Registry of actions the agent can perform (action_registry: ActionRegistry).

Environment: The agent's context or external environment (environment: Environment).

Prompt Construction

construct_prompt() method demonstrates how the agent formulates a prompt for reasoning:

Combines current goals, memory, and available actions.

Uses agent_language to structure the prompt properly.

Lessons Learned / Takeaways

Clear separation of responsibilities: language handling, action registry, memory, and environment.

Importance of type hints for maintainable code (List[Goal], Callable, etc.).

Learned to start modularizing agent behavior for easier experimentation with agentic AI.

Next Steps

Implement memory handling to allow multi-step reasoning.

Create sample actions and integrate them into the action_registry.

Test generate_response with a simple language model interface.
