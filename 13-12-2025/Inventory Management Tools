Today, I implemented simple Python tools for inventory data operations as part of the AI agent framework:

save_item – Adds a new item to the inventory with details like name, description, condition, estimated value, and a unique ID.

get_inventory – Retrieves all items currently stored in the inventory.

get_item – Retrieves a specific item by its unique ID.

These tools are registered using a decorator for easy integration into the agent environment, allowing AI agents to interact with inventory data programmatically.

Key Takeaways:

Practiced tool creation for structured data operations.

Reinforced decorator-based tool registration for agentic workflows.

Built foundational components for AI-powered inventory management agents.
