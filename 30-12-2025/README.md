# Today's learning about Memory of LLM

I have learned today about:
- Context Window
- In-Context Learning
- Short Term Memory

This topics let me know how a llm remember a conversation and why it forget the conversation in new thread.
llm function to learn about conversation
y = fθ(x)
where y is output, f is critical math behind it, thita is billions of parameters in llm, x is input which can be change.

Today's learning was very useful & hope to learn more now about long term memory usage in personal assistant building.
