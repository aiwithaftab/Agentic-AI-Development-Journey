This code defines a tool called read_file and registers it using the @register_tool decorator.
The decorator adds metadata (like name, description, parameters, and tags) so that an AI agent can discover and use this function as a tool.

What the function does

It takes a file path and an optional encoding (default is UTF-8).

Opens the file in read mode.

Returns the entire file's content as a string.

Purpose of the decorator

The @register_tool(tags=["file_operations"]) decorator automatically:

Registers the function as a usable tool.

Stores metadata like its name, docstring, and parameter schema.

Labels it under the "file_operations" tag so agents can categorize it.

Why it matters

This allows your AI agent system to:

Discover this tool programmatically

Show it in a list of available tools

Allow the model to call it via function-calling

Execute the underlying Python function safely
