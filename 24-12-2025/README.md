## Resume Keyword Scoring – Learning Exercise

This repository contains a basic Python implementation for scoring resumes using keyword matching.
It was created as part of my learning process while working on resume screening and ATS-style logic.

## 📘 What I Learned

- Writing clean, reusable Python functions

- Using type hints (List, Dict)

- Basic text processing and keyword matching

- Normalizing scores between defined ranges

- Structuring simple scoring logic for real-world use cases

## 🧠 What the Code Does

- Reads resume text

- Matches it against:

- Required skills

- Experience-related keywords

## Calculates:

- Skill score

- Experience score

- Final weighted score (0–100)

- Returns matched skills for transparency

## ⚙️ Scoring Logic

Skills contribute 50%

Experience contributes 30%

Scores are based on keyword presence
